	(This will be broken until 4.6.1, at least...)

	http://edstarcoordinator.com/api.asmx/GetSystems
	Successfully connecting and updating the Star Systems live
	Successfully saving the Star Systems as persistent data
	Successfully reading the Star Systems from persistent data on StartUp
Moved the raw system data over to "MapController" as this is who needs it
Adaped "MapController" to use the Raw Map Data from EDSC
Laid groundwork on clean refresh of Star Database... this still causes issues and needs attention
Update to 4.6f2



TODO: 
	All of these labels are active... 
		... so these could be used to pick the stars, avoiding colliders!
	Include an options menu to save all of these items:
		Type Size, Type Color, Zoom Cap, Jump Range Cap
	Create "Add New Star" to the UI
	Create "Push star data" to the back end
	Create local representation of the star data so it can be changed
	Consider hiding parts of the query to EDSC, like "DateAndTime", the coordinate filters...
	Need popup warning dialogue in "DataController"
	public RawData rawData; in "DataController" needs to be set to private when done testing
